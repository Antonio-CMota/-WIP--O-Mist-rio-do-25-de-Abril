Cataclysmic Studios Model Readme

Thank you for purchasing one of our products. These models may be used for any projects, but may not be sold individually as your
own work. If you use them in any projects of yours, we'd love to hear about them. Either email us at gamemakerkyle@aol.com
or visit our website at http://www.cataclysmicstudios.com. If you have any questions you may follow the same steps.

All models are of high quality and textured models are fully mapped, with textures provided. The textures are in .bmp or .jpg format for conversion conveniences.
If you wish yo recieve it in another format, you can contact us and request it (include contact information), and we'll send them to you soon after. All of our models are
in .max format, and some include a .3ds to clear version differences. Once again, if you have any preference on the format, email us and we'll see what we can do for you.

Also, if you have any special orders, simply email us and we'll work out pricing and specifications. Please note that in most cases we'd like to use
requested models as products and they will more likely than not be a non-limited release, unless otherwise requested.

Thanks again,
Kyle Maguire
